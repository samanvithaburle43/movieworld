A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film,<br>
or photoplay, is a series of still images that, when shown on a screen, <br>
create the illusion of moving images. <br>

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion <br>
between separate objects viewed in rapid succession. The process of filmmaking<br>
is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes<br>
with a motion-picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using<br>
traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a <br>
combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.<br>
